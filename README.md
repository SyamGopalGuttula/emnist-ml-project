# EMNIST Machine Learning Project

This project is a complete machine learning pipeline using the EMNIST dataset. We will perform data cleaning, preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model training using various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and CNN.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, model training, and analysis.
- `src/`: Python scripts and utility functions.
- `models/`: Saved trained models.
- `report/`: Project report and documentation.
